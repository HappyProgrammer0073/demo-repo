******************** GIT SETUP FOR THIS PROJECT ********************

$ git config --global user.name "Justin Erasmus"  
$ git config --global user.email "erasmusjustin96@gmail.com"

These two credentials are simply used to give you credit for the work that you'll be doing with the version control system.
From here, we can advance to actually makin g our first use of git.

$ git init project1

This creates a directory of that last parameter that we passed in (project1). It is stored on the local machine (under the "demo-repo" repository that we've created earlier.).

$ cd project1

We'll change directory, situating ourselves inside that project directory.

$ git add index.html

Next, we create the file "index.html" and "main.js" and we add that to version control. Adding in this case opts it in to
the next action, which is a commit. The "add" is not yet permanent; it's simply signalling that we want the file to
participate in the next commit.

$ git commit -m"My first commit! YAY!"

We'll conclude by making that permanent record, recording ther state of the file at a given point in time, and we do that
with the "commit command". The "-m" allows us to provide a commit message at the command line. It can be used to describe 
what happened in the activities that are being recorded for this file.
